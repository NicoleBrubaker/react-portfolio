      <h1>Hello, my name is Nicole Brubaker.</h1>
      <p>
        As a fresh face in the world of full stack web development with a love
        for UX/UI design, I'm embarking on a journey filled with learning and
        growth. My passion lies in tackling new challenges and rapidly adapting
        to new technologies. I'm a true team player, enjoying opportunities to
        collaborate, exchange ideas, and contribute to a shared vision. What
        drives me in web development is the thrill of problem-solving and the
        joy of turning concepts into reality. Away from the keyboard, I find joy
        in camping trips and outdoor adventures with my family, experiences that
        refresh and inspire me. My approach to both life and work is grounded in
        positivity, a willingness to learn, and a commitment to making every day
        count.
